- COVID-19 time period would have a lower modularity, average centralities, and larger diameter
- The graph will display Small-World Network properties.
- With time (disregarding COVID-19), the world will become more interconnected, Increasing modularity, centralities and shrinking diameter. 

## Graph Body
